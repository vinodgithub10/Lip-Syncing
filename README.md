# Lip-Syncing with Python and MoviePy

This project demonstrates how to create a lip-synced video by synchronizing an audio file with a video file using Python and the MoviePy library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- moviepy
- librosa
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install moviepy librosa numpy


Usage
Place your video file in the same directory as the script or specify the correct path to the video file in the code.

Place your audio file in the same directory as the script or specify the correct path to the audio file in the code.

Run the script, and it will generate a lip-synced video where the audio matches the lip movements of the characters in the video.

Additional Information
The audio duration will automatically match the video duration.
The video will be trimmed to match the audio duration.
The output video will be saved as output_video.mp4 in the same directory as the script.
